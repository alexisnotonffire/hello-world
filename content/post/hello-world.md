# hello-world
It wouldn't be a tech project without this.

I'm Alex and I enjoy messing around with pretty much anything to do with data and analytics. I currently work in business intelligence and hope to transition into a data science path.

My core skillset is:
- SQL
- Python
- Tableau

My work environment requires:
- Engagement with agile process
- Work with containers
- Delivery within CD and manual release frameworks
- Effective communication with team and stakeholders
- Task priorisation
